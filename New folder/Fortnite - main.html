THE CIRCLE IS ALL THAT MATTERS
One of the most important Fortnite tips is to always be aware of the circle, forever shrinking in size, always ready to swallow you.
 Every strategic decision should be made with your proximity relative to the eye of the storm in mind.

DRINK SHIELD POTIONS IMMEDIATELY (MOST OF THE TIME)
If you get this little pot of blue goodness make sure you snaffle it up, immediately. It will make a big difference to your Fortnite gameplay. The 50% shield buff lasts for the duration of the match, but, since it is a shield buff,
 it will not protect you from certain damage types, like falling. What’s more, you can stack two, doubling your starting max health and giving you a serious advantage.

 LIMIT THE SOUND YOU MAKE
One of the most important Fortnite tips is to keep the decibel level to an absolute minimum. If a player nearby can detect you with some half-decent headphones, they have a significant advantage – even if you are brimming with legendary loot.
This means you should run as little as possible – running is much louder than walking or crouching, and emits noticeable puffs of smoke in your wake – and make sure your surroundings are secure when building or scavenging resources with your pickaxe. Note: other players can hear you when you are switching your weapons.

<p>
USE HEADPHONES
To turn the tables on your enemies you can invest in a decent pair of cans yourself. The game is free, so you have saved some cash to put towards some, really.
Since knowing where other players are is half the battle (royale), wearing headphones can be the difference between life and death – even if you are lacking in loot. Keep your own noise to a minimum and, when you hear another sound, be on the alert.
